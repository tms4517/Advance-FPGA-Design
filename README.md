# Advance-FPGA-Design
This repository implements the examples discussed in the book: "Advanced FPGA design: Architecture, Implementation, and Optimization" by Steve Kilts, in System Verilog.

The repository follows the table of contents in the book.

Each subdirectory contains 3 folders, which consist of the following:
- rtl: Contains System Verilog RTL files.
- tb: Contains basic System Verilog test benches of the RTL.
- doc: Contains PDFs which provide a brief explanation of the synthesized design (using Yosys) and relevant information from the Chapter.

Note: If a tb is not provided for a module, it probably contains errors.
